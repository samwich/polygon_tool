Map polygon creator

Polygon Creator has 3 different modes: 
  Point creation / editing
  Line creation / editing
  Polygon creation / editing

UI
large map view area. points, lines, and polygons will be displayed on the map
item list with 3 tabs
  points on screen (or maybe points that are members of lines or polygons that are on screen?)
  lines on screen
  polygons on screen
editing pane - to edit the currently selected element
  point editor - drag/drop, save, cancel, delete
  line editor - redraw line, save, cancel, assign to block, delete
  polygon editor - redraw polygon, save, cancel, assign to block face, delete

data structures
Points - latitude/longitude pairs
Lines - ordered groups of points
Polygons - ordered groups of points where first and last points are connected

Lines can be used for displaying blocks
Polygons can be used for grouping locations

pseudocode / workflow:

Mode selection
  the user may switch between point, line, and polygon modes at any time

Points mode:
  click on map to add new point
    create new Point object
    display a placemark on the map with the visual style 'unsaved, selected'
    add the Point to the item list
    display the Point in the editing pane so that the user can Save it
      if the user Saves:
        change the placemark visual style to 'saved, selected'
      if the user Cancels:
        destroy the Point object which will remove it from the map, list, and editor
      if the user Deletes:
        refuse to delete the Point if it is a member of any line or polygon
        provide feedback showing which lines and polygons that the Point is a member of
        remove the placemark from the map
        provide undo?
  click and drag a point to move it
    move the placemark on the map
    change the placemark's visual style to 'unsaved, selected'
    put a line segment on the map that goes from the original location to the new location
    change the visual style of every line segment that is attached to the point (parts of Lines and Polygons)
    if the user Saves:
      change the placemark's visual style to 'saved, selected'
      update the polygons and lines that have the Point as a member
    if the user Cancels:
      move the placemark to the its original location
      change it's visual style to 'saved, selected'
  mouse-over an item in the list to highlight the Point on the map

Lines mode:
  click on several Points on the map in-order to create a line
    add a new Line to the item list
    draw a line segment with the visual style 'unsaved, selected' to connect each point to the previous one as it's clicked
    draw a line segment from the last Point to the current mouse location?
    add each Point to the editing pane as it is clicked
    warn the user if any Point is added to the line twice - should it just refuse?
    change the visual style of the Point as it's added?
    disable the Save feature until at least 2 Points have been added
    if the user Saves:
      change the Line's visual style to 'saved, selected'
    if the user Cancels:
      destroy the Line object which will remove it from the map, list, and editor
    if the user chooses to redraw the Line:
      change the visual style of the line to something more subdued
      allow the user to draw a new line
      if the user Saves:
        remove the old line from the map
        change the visual style of the new line
      if the user Cancels:
        remove the new line from the map
        change the visual style of the old line back to 'saved, selected'
    if the user deletes the line:
      destroy the line object, removing the line from the map
  assign to block:
    somehow select a block by name in the editing pane
    allow user to save or cancel
  mouse-over an item in the list to highlight the Line on the map

Polygons mode
  exactly line Lines mode except:
    disable the Save feature until at least 3 Points have been added and the first Point is also the last point
    possibly have an auto-close feature that draws a broken line from the last point to the first point and make the line solid once the Polygon has been saved

UI:
pane at top contains
  mode selection buttons, settings
pane at left contains
  top: item list, bottom: editing area
pane at right contains
  map

visiblePoints collection
visibleLines collection
visiblePolygons collection

Points storage
Lines storage
Polygons storage

mapView
  creates and updates placemarks, polylines, polygons for things in the visibleXxx collections (bound to those collections through controllers)
  passes clicks back to the Point, Line, or Polygon that is clicked
  mapView might have numerous child pointViews, lineViews, polygonViews

listView
  multiple itemViews beneath

editorView

modeSelectorView

mapController

a xListController for each collection of objects (probably an ArrayController)

editorController

MapModel
  data structures to store GMap* objects that are on the map
  methods to add and remove items to/from the data structures
